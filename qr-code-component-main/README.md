## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I learnt that the 62.5% trick can attract compatibility issues with third-party
libraries or plugins

```css
html {
  /* 10px / 16px = 0.625 = 62.5% */
  font-size: 62.5%;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

### Continued development

I will keep improving in how to use the proper units or at least not having
compatibility issues with some third-party libraries

### Useful resources

- [The Surprising Truth About Pixels and Accessibility - The 62.5%
  trick.](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/css/surprising-truth-about-pixels-and-accessibility/#the-sixtwofive-trick-13)
  - This helped me to realized that some tricks maybe useful but also can lead
    to a bad practice
