## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Web accessibility
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

### What I learned

I learnt a lot with this project, it was a small project yet it has many things
to practice like event delegation, I did implement a loader and many other
litle things so I'm happy with the result.

### Continued development

I want to keep learning typescript, I want to be as good as [@MattPocock](https://www.youtube.com/@mattpocockuk) so from now on I will only use typescript for every single project.

### Useful resources

- [coolors](https://coolors.co/39434c) - This helped me find colors, sometimes
  it feels like the style-guide.md does not provide the same colors so with
  coolors you can find many colors

- [Using Dataset in JavaScript](https://medium.com/@adamkearney124/using-dataset-in-javascript-5331af3ec6c3) - This help me write less code or have faster code
